            <p>
                HTML enables us to mark up the content to provide it more meaning behind the scenes. This can be used by search engines, screen readers, outlining tools, and readers of our code in general. We can mark a word as an abbreviation, create lists, display code and output, create tables, mark content as quotes, and provide citations. Browsers may or may not implement standard formatting (such as a dotted underline) or standard behavior (such as a tooltip when you hover over that markup) -- but regardless, we can add our own CSS or JavaScript to ensure such things. The point of HTML isn't to get a visual effect. It's to describe and structure your content.

                <h3>
                    Block vs Inline Tags
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Block-level tags are designed to break up the flow of content on the page with line breaks, normally extend the entire width of their container, and are designed to contain other tags (block and inline). Inline tags do not normally break the flow of content, can contain other inline tags, and are designed to be contained inside block tags, but not to contain block elements themselves.
                </p>

                    <h4>
                        Common Block Level Tags
                    </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Headings - range from level 1 (primary) down to 6 (lowest level). Tags: h1 - h6
                        </li>
                        <li>                        Header – a container at the top to introduce a page or section (can be used more than once per page)</li>

                        <li>
                            Main – a container for primary page content – to be used up to once per page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Footer – a container at the bottom of a page or section, usually providing closing information like copyright and/or contact information or duplicate or lesser navigation (can be used more than once per page).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Nav – a container intended for links, usually limited to main navigation links within the site or page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Article – a stand-alone content area that could even be on its own page. Typical uses would be articles, blog posts, and important self-contained topics.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Section – subsections that group content together and should contain a heading. Not used simply for styling.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Aside – content that is indirectly associated with the primary content (like pull-quotes, secondary nav blocks, advertisements, etc.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Div – the most generic of block-level containers. Previously the go-to standard, now the last resort container.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Paragraph - A standard low-level block element for text and images, but one of the few not designed to contain any other block elements.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            List - Content is broken out (usually with bullet points or numbers) and designed for readability. Tags: ul, ol, dl
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Table: Designed for spreadsheet-style, tabular data, with information stored in individual cells laid out in columns and rows. Once used for page layout purposes, the adoption of CSS encourages tables to only be used grids of information for quick scanning, analysis, and comparison.

                        <li>

                    Semantic vs Non-semantic tags
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Semantic tags are intended to describe the content they contain, which is true to the generally accepted philosophy behind HTML. Examples of semantic tags would include em and strong. Examples of non-semantic tags are those that just describe the formatting of the content, like i for italic and b for bold. (These tags are a throwback to HTML before CSS was created to handle the appearance of the content.) Typically, the semantic em and strong tags, as well the non-semantic i and b tags, result in italic or bold text, respectively. But saying something looks italic only describes its appearance, whereas marking text up with an em tag means it's emphasized. If we use CSS to change the look of that emphasis (say, changing it to be green and bold), it still makes sense to leave it marked up as emphasized. But it wouldn't make sense for it to still be marked italics if that formatting had been removed. Again - use HTML to apply meaning to content rather than formatting.

                    Links
                </h3>
                <h4>Relative vs. Absolute</h4>
                <p>
                    These are the most common types of links
                </p>
                <p>
                    Relative links are for files within your site. A relative link is defined based on the path from the current page or from the root folder.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Here is a relative example: <a href="index.html">Relative link to the Home page</a>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Here is a root relative example: <a href="/index.html">Root-relative link to the Home page.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Absolute links are typically used for locations or resources outside of your website:
                    <a href="http://centriq.com" target="_blank">Centriq Training</a>
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Specialized Links
                </h4>
                <p>
                    You can create a link that opens a new email to a specified email address using the mailto: within the href. This configures a new email in the clients email service. However, it will not work if the client doesn't have an email service configured.
                    <a href="mailto:jared@centriq.com">jared@centriq.com</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Telephone links configure the user's dialer app to prep a phone call.

                </p>
                <p>
                    You can make many elements clickable by putting them into the anchor tags. This includes images:
                    <a href="http://centriq.com" target="_blank">
                        <img src="images/CentriqLogo.png" style="width: 80px" />
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Named anchor or bookmark links refer to a certain id on the page. The IDs are case-sensitive and must be preface with a # just like in CSS.
                </p>
