                    Front End Development
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front end development is the tier of full-stack that deals witht the visual elements of
                    an application that a user interacts with. The languages used in front-end are HTML, CSS
                    and javaScript. These are the only languages that web browsers understand and can render
                    to a browser window.
                </p>
                <section>

                    <p>
                        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used to define the structure of the content of a web page. It is arguably the
                        most important front-end language as it not only provides the content but it also gives CSS and javaScript
                        something to target and modify.
                    </p>

                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used for the formatting and layout of page content. It was introduced as a
                        way to seperate the concerns of markup (HTML) and formatting (CSS) into seperate files.

                    <p>
                        JavaScript (js) allows us to make web pages more interactive. It is often used to add form validation and to
                        perform programming logic in the front end in addition to reacting to page events.

                    been written. It is traditionally written in Latin but there are now many online resources to generate
                    themed text.
